- Scenario-based responses
- Auto-analysis on file upload
- Remove all coding references

### ✅ Phase 7: Testing & Integration
**File**: `docs/phase7-testing-integration.md`
- Comprehensive test suites
- Security validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Deployment checklist

## Architecture Overview

### File Storage Structure
```
~/.mtr/
├── sessions/
│   └── {session-id}/
│       └── uploads/
│           └── *.log
└── tsgs/
    └── {tsg-name}/
        ├── .metadata.json
        └── {uploaded-structure}/
```

### Component Architecture
```
Frontend (React)          Backend (Node.js)
├── SettingsModal        ├── WebSocket Handlers
├── TSGCreator          ├── Storage Management
├── FileUploader        ├── Log Analysis Tools
└── ChatView            └── Agent System
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Security
- Path traversal prevention in all file operations
- File type validation for uploads
- Size limits enforced (100MB for TSGs, 50MB for sessions)
- Read-only command validation

### 2. Performance
- Streaming for large log files
- Pagination for file listings
- Background cleanup for old sessions
- Base64 encoding for file transfers

### 3. User Experience
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Visual TSG file browser
- Active TSG indicator in chat
- Progress feedback for uploads

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers
1. Review the phase-specific implementation guides
2. Start with Phase 1 (remove file manipulation)
3. Test each phase before proceeding
4. Use the verification checklists

### For Users
After implementation:
1. Upload log files via drag-and-drop or file picker
2. Create TSGs by uploading documentation folders
3. Select active TSG for guided troubleshooting
4. Ask questions about uploaded logs

## Migration Strategy

1. **Backup current setup**
2. **Deploy backend changes** (breaking change - removes file editing)
3. **Deploy frontend updates**
4. **Run integration tests**
5. **Update documentation**

## Risk Mitigation

### Breaking Changes
- File editing removal is a breaking change
- Clear communication needed for users
- Consider feature flag for gradual rollout

### Data Management
- Implement proper backup for TSGs
- Monitor storage usage
- Set up alerts for cleanup failures

### Performance
- Test with large log files (>100MB)
- Monitor WebSocket message sizes
- Implement request throttling

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**
   - All file manipulation blocked
   - Log analysis tools working
   - TSG system operational

2. **Performance**
   - File uploads < 30s for 50MB
   - Log analysis < 5s for typical files
   - UI remains responsive

3. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive TSG management
   - Clear file upload feedback
   - Helpful error messages

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation with Phase 1
2. Set up testing environment
3. Create user documentation
4. Plan deployment strategy
5. Prepare migration guide

### Reference Implementation
The Rigel folder structure (`/Rigel/`) serves as an example of a typical TSG with:
- Organized documentation by category
- Troubleshooting guides
- Image assets
- Structured metadata

This transformation will position MTR as a specialized, professional log analysis tool while maintaining its conversational interface and AI capabilities.
