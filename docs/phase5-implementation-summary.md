# Phase 5 Implementation Summary: Session-Based File Upload

## Overview
Phase 5 of the MTR log analyzer transformation has been successfully implemented. This phase added comprehensive session-based file upload capabilities that allow users to upload log files for analysis within investigation sessions.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Storage Enhancements
- **Enhanced session-storage.ts**:
  - Added `deleteSessionFile()` function for removing files
  - Added `getSessionFileInfo()` function with file type detection
  - Implemented file type detection based on extension and content
  - Added `SessionFile` interface with metadata

- **Created session-files.ts**:
  - In-memory session store with enhanced session tracking
  - File management functions (add, remove, sync)
  - Session metadata tracking (file count, total size, timestamps)
  - Active TSG management

### 2. WebSocket Handler Updates
- **Enhanced websocket-handler.ts**:
  - Added handlers for file operations (delete, list, preview)
  - Implemented session context builder with file information
  - Added context refresh on file/TSG changes
  - Real-time file update broadcasting

- **Added message types in types.ts**:
  - `SessionFileDeleteMessage`
  - `SessionFileListMessage`
  - `SessionFilePreviewMessage`
  - Response types for all operations

### 3. Frontend Components
- **Created SessionFileManager.tsx**:
  - Full-featured file management UI
  - Search/filter functionality
  - File preview with truncation
  - Delete functionality
  - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
  - File size and date formatting

- **Updated ChatView.tsx**:
  - Integrated file manager modal
  - Added file manager button with badge
  - Session files indicator bar
  - Modal management

### 4. State Management
- **Updated useCodexStore.ts**:
  - Changed `sessionFiles` from `string[]` to `SessionFile[]`
  - Added `sessionFileStats` tracking
  - Implemented file management actions:
    - `fetchSessionFiles()`
    - `deleteSessionFile()`
    - `previewSessionFile()`
  - Real-time socket event listeners

### 5. Agent Integration
- **Context Enhancement**:
  - Agent now receives session file information
  - Dynamic context updates when files change
  - File details include name, type, and size
  - TSG information included in context

### 6. Security & Validation
- Files are properly sanitized and validated
- Size limits enforced (50MB for sessions)
- File count limits (100 files per session)
- Path traversal protection
- Automatic cleanup of old sessions

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Synchronization**: File changes are broadcast to all connected clients
2. **Preview Capability**: Users can preview file contents with line limiting
3. **Search & Filter**: Quick file search within the manager
4. **Auto-refresh**: File list updates automatically every 5 seconds
5. **Agent Context**: Uploaded files are automatically included in agent context
6. **Session Isolation**: Files are stored per session and cleaned up automatically

## Architecture Flow

```
User uploads file → WebSocket → Session Storage → Enhanced Session → Agent Context
                                      ↓
                              File Manager UI ← Real-time Updates
```

## Testing Coverage
- Upload validator tests
- Session file reader tests
- TSG management tests
- Log analyzer tests

## Next Steps
With Phase 5 complete, the system now has:
- ✅ No file manipulation capabilities (Phase 1)
- ✅ Log analysis tools (Phase 2)
- ✅ TSG management system (Phase 3)
- ✅ TSG UI components (Phase 4)
- ✅ Session-based file upload (Phase 5)

Ready for:
- Phase 6: Update agent prompts for specialized log analysis
- Phase 7: Comprehensive testing and integration
